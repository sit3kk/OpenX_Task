# Description

Functions has been implement as a methods in class Tree

# nodesWithoutChildren()
* I modified BFS algorithm, it visits all nodes in tree and checks if the node has no children.
* Algorithm works in linear time.

# largestNumberEdges()
* It is recursive algorithm, which calculate max height of tree and next can size pf longest path.
* It is also linear time

# compareTree(tree)
* This algorithm works also on BFS, but in this have we have two queue and comparision statement(If children or value is not equal)
* Linear time
